## SQLnano

To understand more about relational databases, how about we build an aplication based on the SQLite architecture to understand the inner details of how they work and interact with data. 

This project tries to answer the question, **how a database works**?

- how is data saved?
- how it's moved?
- how are primary keys and foreign keys created?
- how data is moved from memory to disk?
